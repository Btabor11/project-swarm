# Changelog

## 1.1.0

- Add OpenAI Responses, Gemini generateContent, and local/explicit HTTPS Ollama adapters without npm dependencies.
- Share copied context, exact output ownership, review, and conflict-checked integration across providers.
- Validate structured complete-file responses; reject binary context, unexpected outputs, refusals, truncation, and oversized responses.
- Bound HTTP lifetimes, refuse redirects, omit raw HTTP errors/headers, and preserve credentials outside logs.
- Add provider configuration reports, mixed-provider recipes, API smoke templates, and complete installation of adapter runtime/tests.
- Raise opt-in concurrency to 16 while preserving the default 2. Test four active requests/processes and queued-job cancellation.
- API contract tests are deterministic mocks; live API account/model support is not claimed.


## 1.0.0

First standalone package extracted from the Forge website project's local orchestration tools.

- Fresh Claude Code workers with explicit model selection and concurrency from one to three.
- Explicit input/output manifests, copied workspaces, bounded runtime and logs, and local run records.
- Saved responses with provider metadata when available, status inspection, and cancellation of owned workers.
- Conflict-checked integration of declared outputs, with file-mode preservation and no deletion propagation.
- Local prerequisite diagnostics, manifest validation, and proposed-change inspection.
- An explicit target-project root option and an installer that refuses destination overwrites.
- A reusable orchestration skill, smoke and parallel-review examples, deterministic tests, and setup and extension guides.
- A factual Forge case study distinguishing direct CLI implementation from reusable-runner smoke and review jobs.
- Apache License 2.0.

In 1.0.0, the supported adapter was Claude Code only. Copied workspaces are not an OS security sandbox; Windows support is not claimed.
